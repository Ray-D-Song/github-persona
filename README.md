## What is this?

This is a simple app that allows you to create a persona for your GitHub account, analyze your GitHub activity, generate a score, and rank you in the community.

## Deploy
First, you need to get the Github OAuth Client ID and Client Secret. You can refer to [this](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-an-app) to get them.

Then you can use the button below to deploy to Cloudflare Workers.

This will automatically create a Fork, and fill in the Client ID and Client Secret in the Fork's settings.

Finally, manually trigger the Github Actions to complete the deployment.
